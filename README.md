# GauchoMap

GauchoMap is a Chrome extension made for UCSB students. It attempts to automatically locate all of your UCSB courses as they appear on UCSB GOLD in an interactive map to streamline the process of beginning your next quarter.

Features:

- Adds a new "Open Map" button to UCSB GOLD on the "My Class Schedule" page.
- Pinpoints your UC Santa Barbara courses on a Google Map.
- Filters your courses by day of the week.
- Quick link to the Geography Department's interactive map.
- Clicking on pins opens a detailed view of your classes.
- Pin label displays the number of courses you have at a particular location.
- Works with previous quarters!

Known issues:

- You may be asked to take a swim if GauchoMap can't find your course (Let me know which buildings produce errors so I can fix them).
- Courses in the info boxes don't get filtered by day of the week.
